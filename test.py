test_answer = "The Sharelock Case Study is about two entrepreneurs, Alexandre Molla and Nicolas Louvet, who had the idea of taking on secured bike parking challenges in European cities. They developed a concept for smart, connected, and secure bike locks that could be used to transform useless poles found on the side of the street into a shared bike locks network. They went from concept to the first shared locks system in the world in 15 weeks, with proof of concept 5 weeks after initial engagement. They used secure locks, an iOS and Android app, embedded electronics to ensure reliability and send alerts, and short-run manufacturing to deploy the service with 120 locks."
